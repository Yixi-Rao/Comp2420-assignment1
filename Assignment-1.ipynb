    "- **LO3** - Demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding of descriptive and predictive data analysis methods, optimization and search, and knowledge representation.\n",
    "- **LO4** - Formulate and extract descriptive and predictive statistics from data\n",

    "- The notebook `Assignment-1-uXXXXXXX.ipynb` (where uXXXXXXX is your uid) \n",
    "- A completed `statement-of-originality.md`, found in the root of the forked gitlab repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are performed by pushing to your forked GitLab assignment repository. For a refresher on forking and cloning repositories, please refer to `Lab 1`. Issues with your Git repo (with the exception of a CECS/ANU wide Gitlab failure) will not be considered as grounds for an extension. You will also need to add your details below.

    "* Backup your assignment to your Gitlab repo often. \n",
    "* Extra reading and research will be required. Make sure you include all references in your Statement of Originality. If this does not occur, at best marks will be deduced. Otherwise, academic misconduct processes will be followed.\n",

    "* For all coding questions please write your code after the comment `YOUR CODE HERE`.\n",
    "* In the process of testing your code, you can insert more cells or use print statements for debugging, but when submitting your file remember to remove these cells and calls respectively. You are welcome to add additional cells to the final submission, provided they add value to the overall piece.\n",
    "* You will be marked on **correctness** and **readability** of your code, if your marker can't understand your code your marks may be deducted.\n",
    "* Comment your code.\n",
    "* Before submitting, restart the kernel in Jupiter Lab and re-run all cells before submitting your code. This will ensure the namespace has not kept any old variables, as these won't come across in submission and your code will not run. Without this, you could lose a significant number of marks.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ever-evolving world of technology, security is everything. To the general consumer, security of a device can be a trivial point as they might have \"Nothing to Hide\". This argument alone is [considered flawed](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2018/11/20/read-this-if-youve-got-nothing-to-hide/), although we are not here to argue this point. For the purposes of this assignment, we are focused on how device security is important for protecting information. This may have many use cases, such as protecting a [businesses trade secrets](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/china-s-hackers-are-stealing-secrets-u-s-firms-again-n917836) or a [government's records on it's citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach). So, how do we know the system we are using is secure?\n",
    "\n",
    "The software development and security community has taken a very \"open\" approach to highlighting the vulnerabilities in products. Software companies, private and public, commit to ensuring their devices are secure. This placement requires a level of accountability to be in place for their insecurities, and allowing scrutiny from external parties. To this end, systems such as the **Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) system** exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) system?\n",
    "Think of it like a database that holds a number of the publicly known vulnerabilities that exist for software. The CVE system is the de-facto identifying system for publicly exposed vulnerabilities in systems, used by Apple, Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, etc. The CVE is a schema that allows the consistent storing of information regarding vulnerabilities. However, the CVE system alone is incomplete, and extended by organisations such as the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**. More reading on the CVE is [here](https://cve.mitre.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another Acronym? What is the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)?\n",
    "Get used to it, there are plenty more coming. The NVD is a publicly available US database that holds information regarding all current CVEs. More reading can be found [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what are we doing with this?\n",
    "Good question! In part to achieve the \"security\" aspect of this course, and to test your python, data analysis and basic machine learning skills, you will be working on a CVE-inspired dataset to answer a number of questions.\n",

You are only able to patch _n_ vulnerabilities due to budget limitations, and therefore need a way to prioritise which vulnerabilities need patching. While the CVSS systems provide a good general system for determining the threat level of a vulnerability, you are more concerned with weaknesses that can be exploited over a **network**, and require minimal user interaction.\n",

Your team is small and resources are limited, and therefore you will not be able to patch every issue available. You want to develop a triage<sup>*</sup> system for assessing vulnerabilities to advise organisations of the threats they may face based on the relative danger of having unpatched vulnerabilities in their environments, and determine the most severe vulnerabilities which will need patching by your team when advising organisations. Your team is mainly focused upon network attacks that require minimal user interaction, although you assume that the complexity of carrying out a specific exploit is not important due to the skills of your adversaries. Your team is not familiar with the CVSS system, and has a basic understanding of what the CVE system is, and therefore you need to account for this in your explanation and development of the system.\n",
